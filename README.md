# SGD-Regressor-for-Multivariate-Linear-Regression

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the price of the house and number of occupants in the house with SGD regressor.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
Step 1: Load California housing data, select features and targets, and split into training and testing sets.

Step 2: Scale both X (features) and Y (targets) using StandardScaler.

Step 3: Use SGDRegressor wrapped in MultiOutputRegressor to train on the scaled training data.

Step 4: Predict on test data, inverse transform the results, and calculate the mean squared error.

## Program:
